(Note:  The specific Bagrodia Algorithm for binary rendezvous was not found in the
provided PDF materials or standard textbook sections outlined. The following describes
the general concept of binary rendezvous and a plausible mechanism  which may or
may not align perfectly with the specific Bagrodia algorithm taught.)
Binary Rendezvous:  Rendezvous is a synchronization mechanism in message passing
where both the sender and receiver must be ready to communicate before the message
transfer occurs. It acts as a synchronization point. In binary rendezvous   only two
processes are involved: one sender and one receiver.
The core idea is that the first process to arrive at the communication point (either the
sender ready to send or the receiver ready to receive) must wait for the other process to
arrive before the communication (message transfer) can proceed. This ensures tight
synchronization between the pair.
General Mechanism (Illustrative  not necessarily Bagrodia's):  A common way to
implement binary rendezvous involves handshake messages:
Sender Initiates:
Process P1 (Sender) wants to send message M to Process P2 (Receiver) via
rendezvous.
P1 sends a READY_TO_SEND(M)  message to P2.
P1 blocks  waiting for an acknowledgment from P2.
Receiver Arrives:
When P2 is ready to receive  it checks if a READY_TO_SEND  message has
arrived from P1.
If yes: P2 accepts the message M  performs the receive operation  and sends
an ACK_RECEIVE  back to P1.
If no: P2 blocks  waiting for the READY_TO_SEND  message.
Completion:
When P1 receives the ACK_RECEIVE  from P2  it knows the rendezvous is
complete and the message has been transferred. P1 unblocks and continues
execution.1.
P2  having received the message  also continues execution.
(Alternative: Receiver Initiates)  A similar handshake can occur if the receiver reaches the
receive point first  sending a READY_TO_RECEIVE  message and waiting for the sender.
Diagram (Conceptual Handshake):
Case 1: Sender arrives first
Time ->
P1(Sender ):---READY_TO_SEND (M)-->|(Blocks )
| |
| |<--ACK_RECEIVE ---
| | |
P2(Receiver ):-------------- (Ready toReceive )-------------> (Receives M Unblocks P1)
Case 2: Receiver arrives first
P1(Sender ):-------------- (Ready toSend )-------------> (Sends M Unblocks P2)
|<--READY_TO_RECEIVE ---
P2(Receiver ):---READY_TO_RECEIVE -->|(Blocks )
Key Aspects:  * Synchronization:  Ensures both sender and receiver are ready before
transfer. * Blocking:  The first process to arrive typically blocks. * Atomicity:  The
message transfer and synchronization appear as a single atomic event to the
participating processes.
Without the specific details of the Bagrodia algorithm  this general explanation covers
the core principles of binary rendezvous.
Question 5: How distributed mutual exclusion can be
implemented? Detail with system model. (10 Marks)
Concept:  Distributed Mutual Exclusion (DME) Implementation Approaches  System
Model.
Syllabus Relevance:  Module 3 (Distributed mutual exclusion algorithms  System
model).
Answer:◦
(This question is identical to Question 5 from Midterm Paper 1. Please refer to the
detailed answer provided for Midterm Paper 1  Question 5  which covers the system
model and the three basic approaches: Non-Token-Based (Permission-Based)  Token-
Based  and Quorum-Based  with examples like Lamport  Ricart-Agrawala  Suzuki-
Kasami  and Maekawa  along with conceptual diagrams.)
[Content from Midterm Paper 1  Question 5 Answer would be inserted here]
Summary of the three approaches:  1. Non-Token-Based:  Request permission from
others (e.g.  all others)  use timestamps for ordering (Lamport  Ricart-Agrawala). 2.
Token-Based:  Circulate a unique token; only the holder enters CS (Suzuki-Kasami 
Raymond's Tree). 3. Quorum-Based:  Request permission from a subset (quorum) with
intersection property (Maekawa).
Each approach requires specific assumptions about the system model (process
behavior  network reliability  message ordering  synchrony) and offers different
performance and fault-tolerance characteristics.
